# Huffman-Coding
Huffman coding provides an efficient, unambiguous code by analyzing the frequencies that certain symbols appear in a message.

For communicating through digital mediums, we must encode messages into bit streams first. In such a system,
the sender needs an encoder for encoding text messages into bit streams, and the recipient, on receiving this bit
stream, uses a decoder for reconstructing the original message.The algorithm, Huffman
Coding, can encode text messages into bit streams of minimal length.

## Note for contributors
The project is open for contributions and is hacktoberfest registered! 

The project focuses on providing code snippets with pseudocodes for Huffman Coding in different programming languages.
